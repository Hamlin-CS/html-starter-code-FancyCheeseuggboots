<p> Step 2: The next step is toner! Some people say it's optinal, I visited a skin specialist and she said that not only is it important but if you have the right one it can help prevent acne. She gave me a toner made from Calendula extract. Because it was from her own brand which is not in stores i found the next best one. I would also like to say that depending on your acne type toner might not be the best option</p>
