<p> Step 4: Moisturizer Ok so technically eye cream would come next and if you use that great, I however dont really think it works so i skip that. Also being a teenager the best way to reduce under eye cyrcles is sleep, and ice. Back to the moisturizer this step is crucial even if you have acne and oily skin. For the longest time I thought that becUSE I have oily skin that I can skip moisterizer, but that actually causes your pores to profduce more oil. Even if you have acne chancds are you use lots of exfoliants and drying agents so keeping your skin barrier healthy is important. This is not to say that all skin types can use the same moisturizer and if you have oily skin you will probably want a thin cream for night and a good sunscreen thats non comobojenic. My favorite is La Roche Possay's Tolerane moustier barrier repair, and for my sunscreen all of the facial sunscreens form Elta MD. </p>
