<p>Step 3: Serum  So many people have differnt opinions on serum. Weather it does anything, does it cause acne, can it clog pores, what qualifies as a serum? Well from what i have expirenced people with acne should use different exfolient acids. Glycolic Acid is really great for unclogging pores, and after any extraction or breakout I love to put it on. Personally I have never tried Azelic Acid serum, or even Salicylic acid serum, but some of my friends say that theese work really well for them and they love it. Similar to the toner my skin specialist gave me her own brand so there is no brand to shop from. However after doing some research  found theese similar products.
